Note: this is cobbled together from the Human Rights Scores Dataverse and the CIRI Human Rights Data Project Dataverse: two excellent resources if you are interested in the topic!

Variables: 

[country] --- Country identifier

[year] --- Year identifier  

[time] --- Time index (corresponds to year)

[humanrights] --- Overall human rights score for the corresponding country-year. Higher values indicate better a human rights record. 

[tort] --- Torture refers to the purposeful inflicting of extreme pain, whether mental or physical, by government officials or by private individuals at the instigation of government officials. Torture includes the use of physical and other force by police and prison guards that is cruel, inhuman, or degrading. This also includes deaths in custody due to negligence by government officials. A score of 0 indicates that torture was practiced frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that torture was practiced occasionally; and a score of 2 indicates that torture did not occur in a given year.

[disap] --- Disappearances are cases in which people have disappeared, political motivation appears likely, and the victims have not been found. Knowledge of the whereabouts of the disappeared is, by definition, not public knowledge. However, while there is typically no way of knowing where victims are, it is typically known by whom they were taken and under what circumstances. A score of 0 indicates that disappearances have occurred frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that disappearances occasionally occurred; and a score of 2 indicates that disappearances did not occur in a given year.

[genocide] --- A binary variable for genocide from Harff's 2003 APSR article.

[kingsfans] --- Proportion of the population who are fans of the Sacramento Kings.
